    <div class="help" style="justify-content: stretch">
        <p>I am currently unemployed and am devoting as much time as I can to building modules and contributing to the Foundry community. Presently, this amounts to many hours a day.</p>
        <p>Without your support, I'm afraid I will have to greatly reduce the amount of time I can devote to my projects and to you, the wonderful people of the Foundry community.</p>
        <p>I recognize that not everyone has the resources to do so (which is fine!), but <strong>if you can safely afford that, please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/forien" target="_blank">becoming a Patron</a></strong>. ALL contributions help, regardless of level.  It really would mean the world to me and I can't thank you enough for even considering it. Let's build more awesome functionality into FoundryVTT together!</p>
    </div>

<!--    <p>I feel bad about reaching you like that, but I need to. I am currently unemployed and I spent last month learning and building modules for Foundry. Quest Log is my biggest undertaking in this regard. I work on it pretty much daily, for many hours.</p>-->
<!--    <p>However, I might not be able to continue to do so and be <em>forced</em> to find a job to simply pay my bills and my free time would shrink drastically.</p>-->
<!--    <p>So that's why I'm asking for your help. Hundreds of people downloaded this module and I understand that many of you might be in bad situation as well, totally understandable. But please, <strong>if you can safely afford that, please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/forien" target="_blank">becoming a Patron</a></strong>. Every little support counts. It would mean world to me and I would really appreciate every help that would allow me to work on this and many more awesome modules as my job!</p>-->
