/**
 * Provides a custom override to DocumentOwnershipConfig enabling GM & trusted player w/ edit capabilities to alter
 * quest ownership. The default DocumentOwnershipConfig only allows GM level users permission editing.
 *
 * When the underlying document / {@link JournalEntry} is updated the {@link QuestDB} will receive this update and
 * fire {@link QuestDBHooks} that other parts of FQL can respond to handle as necessary. In particular
 * {@link ViewManager} handles these hooks to update the GUI on local and remote clients when ownership change.
